Path finding assignment. This project will display 3 maps on the console. A map with the PC in a random room in the map,
the distances from the PC to the other rooms and corridors, and the last map which is the distance from the PC to the 
rest of the map. NOTE that the las map does not take into consideration of the outermost rows and columns (the rows & columns that have the border characters).
